# 🌿 What is Flowzz Rezept Helfer 🔎⚕️📝🌿?

Flowzz Rezept Helfer 🔎⚕️📝🌿 is a powerful browser extension that supports eligible medical marijuana patients in Germany in finding their prescribed cannabis flowers at the best available price at their favorite pharmacy.
It runs with Chrome, Firefox and Edge and uses real time data from [flowzz.com](https://flowzz.com/) which is the largest database for legal cannabis in Germany!

# ⚕️ Medical Cannabis in Germany
In Germany, the medical use of cannabis has been permitted since 2017 under certain conditions. The country's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) was responsible for regulating the importation and distribution of medicinal cannabis products.
Due to a change in German legislation on April 1st, 2024, coinciding with the quasi-legalization of cannabis for recreational use, the conditions and regulations for medical use of cannabis flowers in Germany changed significantly. 
Cannabis can now also be prescribed for “mild” medical conditions such as migraines and sleep disorders. There is no regulation stating that you have to be “fully treated” first. This was the case before the legalization of medical cannabis, when an exemption had to be fought for in court.

Cannabis therapy can alleviate symptoms of the following illnesses:

Chronic pain, sleep disorders, migraines, headaches, ADHD, depression, tinnitus, abdominal pain, obsessive-compulsive disorder, cancer, ulcerative colitis, Chron's disease, fibromyalgia, hyperhidrosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, PTSD, Tourette's disease.

# Patient Challenges
Patients seeking for remediation of their symptoms through the use of medical cannabis, maybe for the first time, are now facing three challenges:

* finding a doctor who are aware of the health benefits medical cannabis can have for a wide range of patients and symptoms and therefore prescribe it
* finding the right flowers from the right strain (which is best suited to remediate their symptoms best) 
* finding pharmacies who have the desired flowers available and can fill these prescriptions at the most economic price point.

A number of 'Telemedicine' platforms have sprouted in 2024, connecting patients to doctors to get a prescription and enable the doctors to send the medication to a pharmacy the patients selects.
While these platforms work reasonably well if you don't care for price or don't want to get your medication from your favorite pharmacy.
The prices of medical cannabis flowers vary by as much as 40-50% between pharmacies, depending on supply and demand and to find the best price at a pharmacy you like to work with is a tedious challenge.
Since not all patients can rely on their medical insurance to cover the cost for the medication, price is very relevant to them.
And even with support of a website like Flowzz.com, it is sometimes hard to beat the market if you are trying to fill your prescription at a economically feasible price.

# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Project
Flowzz Rezept Helfer 🔎⚕️📝🌿 is a community project first published in the [r/Cannabis_Apotheken](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cannabis_Apotheken/) community on reddit in July of 2024.
For German medical cannabis patients, this subreddit serves as a discussion forum about their experiences with pharmacies, doctors, and specific strains.
The developer has been picking up on several feature requests from of patients, thus identifying opportunities to improve the software.
